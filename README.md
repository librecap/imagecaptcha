# ImageCaptcha

Generate highly secure, accessible image CAPTCHAs. Human recognizable but bot-resistant image challenges with sequences of characters, slider puzzle captchas and sophisticated obfuscation techniques. 

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/librecap/imagecaptcha.git
cd imagecaptcha/sliding
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python generate_captcha.py
```

## Overview

ImageCaptcha is a Python library for generating highly secure, accessible image CAPTCHA challenges that are human recognizable but resistant to automated attacks. The library provides various types of visual challenges including character sequences (coming soon) and slider puzzles, with sophisticated obfuscation techniques to enhance security while maintaining usability. The CAPTCHAs are designed to be intuitive for humans to solve while incorporating multiple layers of bot-detection mechanisms.

This is a Prove of Concept implementation intended to be used for a Rust implementation for the LibreCap project.

## Features/Types
